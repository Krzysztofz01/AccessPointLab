#  AccessPointLab

AccessPointLab is a fork of the client application of the [AccessPointMap](https://github.com/Krzysztofz01/AccessPointMap) project, which is a version stripped of the multi-user functionality. It is ideal for local hosting, to manage the AccessPointMap server and to test the collected logs, also those from other projects that have been supported, e.g. [Wigle](https://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving) or [Aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng). AccessPointLab is not associated with any specific [AccessPointMap](https://github.com/Krzysztofz01/AccessPointMap) instance, so it allows you to manage more systems.
