#  AccessPointLab

The AccessPointLab project is a *fork* of the client application of the [AccessPointMap](https://github.com/Krzysztofz01/AccessPointMap) project (version **0.5.0**), with full compatibility with the latest version. AccessPointLab does not have the multi-user support, therefore it is much lighter and single-user-friendly. The purpose of AccessPointLab is to host it locally for local analysis of data collected by AccessPointMap and other compatible formats, detailed information can be found on the AccessPointMap project page. AccessPointLab allows you to connect to many AccessPointMap instances, so it is also suitable for audits and development of the AccessPointMap itself or related tools.

# Features
